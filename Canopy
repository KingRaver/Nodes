Let me explain how the first deep funding pilot of $170k in ETH for Ethereum's OSS dependencies connects to an often overlooked but critical infrastructure need.

When we think about Ethereum's dependencies, we often focus on software libraries, code bases, and direct technical dependencies. However, one crucial yet underfunded dependency category is mid-sized server farm operations across the globe.

These aren't massive centralized data centers, but rather professional node operations that:
- Provide robust computational power for the network
- Maintain geographic distribution and decentralization
- Operate at a scale above home nodes but below major cloud providers
- Require significant technical expertise and capital investment

This infrastructure layer is currently underfunded in the Ethereum ecosystem, despite being critical for:
- Network resilience and performance
- Reducing reliance on major cloud providers
- Supporting growing network demands
- Maintaining true decentralization

We can look to Filecoin as an example of how to better support this type of infrastructure - they've successfully created incentives for mid-sized storage providers around the world.

The $170k pilot to identify critical dependencies could be an opportunity to recognize and start addressing this infrastructure gap. While software dependencies are obviously important, the ecosystem also needs to consider how to better fund and incentivize these crucial infrastructure providers that sit between individual stakers and centralized server farms.

Would you like me to elaborate on how this type of infrastructure support could be structured within Ethereum's funding initiatives?
